                <blockquote><p> <strong>Making your own plan a few thoughts from a life of doing!</strong>&nbsp;When rising through the ranks to senior management roles, and ultimately to the c-suite, you will find that the role of CEO, CIO or CDO is less and less about what you knew and got you there, and more about what you can assimilate and apply the foundations of strategy, leadership and governance. </p><p>For me personally “Yes, technology (the ubiquitous ‘digital’) is important and yes, like me there is huge benefit to be practiced and know what technology can do for the organisation, but the role is more strategy-focused and this is the new "groundwork” we must all do. we all have business lives that take us into multiple disciplines. and Working in interim positions and consulting you have less and less time to move from formulation to acting!</p><p>In this leadership role, the insight of what the language being used by the market (the vocabluary e.g. "Self organising teams", "Restful") is accepted to mean and what it could do for an organisation and how to assemble the people and resources to do this takes priority over detailed technical knowledge of systems and hardware. I decided to produce this site to bring together some useful concepts, theorys and cooky cutter ideas that can help individuals develop there own foundation.</p><p> In a world of Fake news I make no appology for this site containing concepts and ideas that expand the journey we are all on to reach our potential, A word of advice Learn the language and “Build relationships down, across, up and outside the organisation”. Anyone in this position is often invited to events and networking opportunities. Choosing to attend these (even if they are outside of working hours) to discuss ideas, develop relationships and build alliances is time consuming but pays dividends.</p></blockquote>

                    <li><strong>Metrics</strong> - Digitalisation probably does not need Metrics or if it does it needs ones you might not have thought of it is all about your industry being an ecosystem and the continual goal of being an "Apex Predator" in that eco system and what happens when the last one dies.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Economics</strong>&nbsp;-Even if you don't want to be the Apex Predator than the economics of doing things right, faster, building in resiliance and flexibility are always finacially rewarding for the organisation</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision</strong>&nbsp;<strong>process</strong>- Most organisations have implememented project portfoilo management to prioitise and drive their strategic innitiatives forward and control the budget, but how with the huge backlog of items a digital transformation can require do you move forward minimizing the overhead on your agile teams (once you have them of course), providing the control and governance all of which is about Risk Management of the portfolio.</li><li><strong>Decision criteria</strong>- So now as always there are so many ways to achieve the same thing and the whole proposition of a digital transformation is about connections and velocity and teams, so you have impact on Recruitment and training, Vendor selection and audit, Communication and change management, as well as budget, functionality, compliance &nbsp;and risk, an easy solution today may cause problems later. Functional fit is not enough anymore.</li><li><strong>identify pain</strong> - This is one area where I like using Cynefin from Dave Snowdon, it breaks &nbsp;systems and states (People+ technology and process) into 5 catagories and gives you rules on how to manage systems in this state, it hilites something that should be obvious but not considered by most that is the worst state chaos most commonly comes out of a change in a simple system!</li><li><strong>Champion</strong> - The key players that have the Influence and the power to drive these individual transformations forward, this is seldom in reality the source of the money, and maybe completely outside the organisation, they can articulate the transformation in ways people understand and foster commitment.</li>
